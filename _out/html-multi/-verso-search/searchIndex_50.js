Filters in probability","context":"Notes on Mathlib","contents":"The general question is:\n\nConvergence in Mathlib is usually formulated with filters. I wonder how they can be useful in probability.\n\nLet us start by recalling what a filter (and ultrafilter) is:\n\nA filter F on a type α is a collection of sets of α which contains the whole α,\nis upwards-closed, and is stable under intersection. We do not forbid this collection to be\nall sets of α.The set of sets that belong to the filter.The set Set.univ belongs to any filter.If a set belongs to a filter, then its superset belongs to the filter as well.If two sets belong to a filter, then their intersection belongs to the filter as well.\n\nAn ultrafilter is a minimal (maximal in the set order) proper filter.An ultrafilter is nontrivial.If g is a nontrivial filter that is less than or equal to an ultrafilter, then it is greater\nthan or equal to the ultrafilter.\n\nOur goal is to formulate tightness in terms of filters. Recall that tigthness means:\n\nA set of measures S is tight if for all 0 < ε, there exists a compact set K such that\nfor all μ ∈ S, μ Kᶜ ≤ ε.\nThis is formulated in terms of filters, and proven equivalent to the definition above\nin IsTightMeasureSet_iff_exists_isCompact_measure_compl_le.\n\n/- Define some constants. -/\n\ndef m : Nat := 1       -- m is a natural number\ndef n : Nat := 0\ndef b1 : Bool := true  -- b1 is a Boolean\ndef b2 : Bool := false\n\n/- Check their types. -/\n\n#check m            -- m : Nat\n#check n\n#check n + 0        -- n + 0 : Nat\n#check m * (n + 0)  -- m * (n + 0) : Nat\n#check b1           -- b1 : Bool\n-- \"&&\" is the Boolean and\n#check b1 && b2     -- b1 && b2 : Bool\n-- Boolean or\n#check b1 || b2     -- b1 || b2 : Bool\n-- Boolean \"true\"\n#check true         -- Bool.true : Bool\n\n/- Evaluate -/\n\n#eval 5 * 4         -- 20\n#eval m + 2         -- 3\n#eval b1 && b2      -- false\n\n\n-- This block initializes a Lean context\n\n\ndef MeasureTheory.Measure.IsTight {α : Type u_1} [TopologicalSpace α] [MeasurableSpace α] (ℙ : Measure α) : Prop := InnerRegularWRT ℙ IsCompact (fun x ↦ x = Set.univ)\n\n\ndef atTopCompact [TopologicalSpace α] : Filter (Set α) :=\n  ⨅ (K : Set α) (_ : IsCompact K), Filter.principal {B | K ⊆ B}\n\n\nWe will show one part of the Prohorov Theorem: If [PolishSpace α], and S : Set (Measure α) and ∀ s ∈ S, IsProbabilityMeasure s, then [IsTightMeasureSet S] implies relative compactness of S in the topology of weak convergence.\n\n* A set s in a topological space is compact iff every ultrafilter in s converges.* α is equivalent to a measurable subset of a compact space β. (This is not yet implemented in Mathlib.)* If IsCompact α, any S : Set (Measure α) is relatively compact.\n\n\n"}});
